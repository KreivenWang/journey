Hello! I am glad to have the opportunity to interview for the position of digital expert at your company.

I am Wang Xiaoping, you can call me Kreiven. I have 10 years' experience in front-end development. Starting with C# WPF, I’ve grown into a full-stack engineer in Angular/React/Vue, Spring Boot, and MongoDB. At Citibank, I led the development of the front-end part and the APIs for a bond order system and drove Highly scalable solutions from the very beginning. This system allows trading of all kinds of bonds in a live environment using Websocket.

I also led two innovative projects that won awards in the company. One project was creating a system to monitor the health of over 30 services, which helps keep our production environment stable. The other project used AI Agent technology to build a tool. This tool makes it easier to turn requirement documents into flowcharts and vice versa, streamlining our workflow.

I’m always eager to learn new things. I study through online courses to keep up with the latest industry trends. I organize monthly sessions within our team. In these sessions, we explore new technologies and discuss how to improve the ones we already use. All these experiences show my technical skills, my ability to think creatively, and my teamwork spirit in delivering useful solutions.
